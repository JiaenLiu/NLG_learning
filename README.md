# KPG_learning
This repository's purpose is to record some insprition while learn the KPG

## Abstract
The reason why I decide to write this document is that I want to record something I discover during reading these papers. I think these paper is very helpful while doing some NLP research, more specifically, just in Keyphrase generation. To catch the latest technology, these material is very necessary to learn. Without future ado, Let's begin.

## Material
An Empirical Study on Neural Keyphrase Generation (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10229)  
Does Order Matter? An Empirical Study on Generating Multiple Keyphrases as a Sequence (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03590)  
One Size Does Not Fit All: Generating and Evaluating Variable Number of Keyphrases (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05241)

## Introduction
As we all know, keyphrases are phrase that summarize and highlight important information in a piece of text. So keyphrase generation (KPG) is a task that automatically predicting such phrase in the given source text. More specifically, one source text can have mupltiple keyphrases and these keyphrase can just be in the original text (i.e., sub-string of) or absent from the source text.
