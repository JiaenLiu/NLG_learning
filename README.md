# NLG_learning
This repository's purpose is to record some insprition while learn the NLG

## Abstract
The reason why I decide to write this document is that I want to record something I discover during reading these papers. I think these paper is very helpful while doing some NLP research, more specifically, in Key phrase generation, to catch the latest technology these material is very necessary to learn. Without future ado, Let's begin.

## Material
An Empirical Study on Neural Keyphrase Generation (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10229)  
Does Order Matter? An Empirical Study on Generating Multiple Keyphrases as a Sequence (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03590)  
One Size Does Not Fit All: Generating and Evaluating Variable Number of Keyphrases (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05241)  
PositionRank: An Unsupervised Approach to Keyphrase Extraction from Scholarly Documents (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1102.pdf)
